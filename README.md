# Overview
This dataset is a refined and expanded version of Chinese ConceptNet.  
(the original ConceptNet dataset is in [commonsense/conceptnet5](https://github.com/commonsense/conceptnet5/wiki))

ConceptNet collected commonsense knowledge from voluntary web users all around the world (crowd-sourcing).  
It contains a variety of domains in real-world and can be applied in different tasks, such as analogy, commonsense reasoning and natural language understanding. 

Knowledge acquired by crowds tend to be noisy, redundancy and meaningless especially for unguided projects without supervision and voluntary participants.
Therefore, we refined ConceptNet to reduce its error rate.  
In the mean time, we increased the quality of ConceptNet. The quality here refers to correctness, coverage and number of concepts.
